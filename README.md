## Thank you
Thanks to all the incredible people that worked hard to make these incredible and open-source pieces
of software. Their documenters even more so; I can't imagine the work it takes to write thorough

## (UN)LICENSE
I would appreciate credit (and do message and tell me how this helped you! I'm curious) but it is
very much not necessary.
